            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-1"> Pregnancy in a woman who is 19 years old or younger is referred to as a teen pregnancy. A woman can become pregnant after having regular monthly periods if she has vaginal intercourse with a male at any age. When you miss a period, you'll most likely know you're pregnant. However, if you get a very light period around the time you anticipate it, don't rule out the possibility of becoming pregnant. In the first few weeks of pregnancy, very mild bleeding is possible.</p>

            <p class="u-align-justify u-text u-text-2"> Pregnancy-related high blood pressure and associated consequences are more common in teenagers than in average-age moms. Premature delivery and low birth weight are two risks for the infant. Preeclampsia can also affect the mother's or baby's kidneys, and it can potentially be deadly. Pregnant teenagers are likewise more likely to become fragile. Anemia is a condition in which the quantity of red blood cells in the body is reduced (RBCs). This might make you feel weak and fatigued, and it can also impair the growth of your kid. In the United States, giving birth is safer than it has ever been, yet it is still riskier for an adolescent than for a woman 20 or older. <span style="font-weight: 700;"></span>

            <p class="u-text u-text-3"> Complications during pregnancy or delivery, according to the World Health Organization, are the greatest cause of mortality for females aged 15 to 19. If you become pregnant as a teenager, you may be afraid of informing your family and friends. You may feel more alone and sad if you do not speak to someone or receive the aid and support you require. This can cause issues both at home and at school. Many pregnant adolescent girls drop out of school, and others never finish. As a result, many moms who become pregnant as adolescents are poor. Women who become pregnant as teenagers are more likely to have several children.</p>

Others rely on family members to help them raise their children. Although finishing school and finding a decent career might be difficult, it is possible with hard effort and assistance. If your adolescent intends to retain the baby, talk about the difficulties and obligations that will be involved. </p>
